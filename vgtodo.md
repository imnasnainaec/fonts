        - Common uses
            - Use this as a source for programmatically grabbing the latest version of SIL fonts
            - Download and inspect the font family metadata to find fonts from SIL and others
        - SIL and partner web sites and applications can use this as a webfont service by linking directly to woff/woff2 files.
            - This is not recommended for use by the general public due to performance and bandwidth limitations. At some point we may, without notice, restrict webfont use from this site to only registered sites and users, at which point unregistered access will no longer work.
    - Limitations on use
        - No guarantees, no responsibility
        - You may not use this site as a webfont source unless you understand that future access may be limited to registered sites and applications from SIL and partner organizations.
