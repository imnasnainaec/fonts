This font contains complete coverage of all the characters defined in Unicode for Ethiopic. The Ethiopic script is used for writing many of the languages of Ethiopia and Eritrea. [Ethiopic (U+1200..U+137F)](https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1200.pdf) was added to Unicode 3.0. [Ethiopic Supplement (U+1380..U+139F)](https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1380.pdf) and [Ethiopic Extended (U+2D80..U+2DDF)](https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2D80.pdf) were added to Unicode 4.1. [Ethiopic Extended-A (U+AB00..U+AB2F)](https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/UAB00.pdf) was added to Unicode 6.0. [Ethiopic Extended-B U+1E7E0..U+1E7FF)](https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1E7E0.pdf)  was added to Unicode 14.0. *Abyssinica SIL* supports all Ethiopic characters which are in Unicode. As far as we are aware, all languages using the Ethiopic script are now fully represented in Unicode.

A selection of characters from the General Punctuation block, such as various-sized spaces, are also supported; a utility such as <a href="https://scripts.sil.org/ViewGlyph_home">SIL ViewGlyph</a> can be used to examine the exact repertoire of this font. 

¹Inclusion of basic Latin repertoire is provided as a convenience, e.g., for use in menus or for displaying markup in text files; these fonts are not intended for extensive Latin script use.

## Private-use (PUA) characters

Because the majority of the PUA characters have now been encoded into Unicode, or they were considered glyph variants, all PUA characters in the font have been removed with the exception of U+E494 (<span class='abyssinica-R normal'></span>) and U+E496 (<span class='abyssinica-R normal'></span>). Some of the PUA codepoints were actually glyph variants of characters already encoded in Unicode. These are now available through OpenType Character Variants or TypeTuned fonts. See [Font Features](features).

PUA characters that were previously in the font are documented here:
