      The Galatia SIL fonts contain most of the symbols defined in Unicode
      3.1 for Latin-1, Greek (excluding Coptic), Macintosh Character Set (US
      Roman), and 850WE/Latin-1 and are supplied in Regular and Bold
      weights.

      Two fonts from this typeface family are included in this release:

           * Galatia SIL Regular
           * Galatia SIL Bold

      There are no OpenType tables in this font. Thus, there is no automatic
      formation of the final sigma.

      More detail on the font can be seen at
      http://scripts.sil.org/GalatiaSIL.


      ChangeLog
      ----------
      (This should list both major and minor changes, most recent first.)

          13 Jul 2009 Version 2.1
          - rereleased with fixed Mac license string
          
          12 Jun 2009 Version 2.1 OFL release of Galatia SIL.
          - released under OFL
          - 'vdmx' table recalculated because of errors in the font
            causing some Java[tm] applications on some Windows machines to 
            not display glyphs in Galatia SIL
          
          30 Jun 2005 Version 2.0.1
          - 'hhea' table of the two TrueType fonts has been modified, 
            because an error in the metrics specified there could cause 
            some software, particularly some packages running on Linux, 
            to crash or otherwise perform incorrectly.
          
          5 Oct 2002 Version 2.0
          - reencoded for Unicode
          - name changed to "Galatia SIL" to reflect new SIL 
            font naming conventions
          - added:
          	03D7	GREEK KAI SYMBOL
          	03F3	GREEK LETTER YOT
          	03F4	GREEK CAPITAL THETA SYMBOL
          	Combining Diacritics
          	Latin-1 (MS Windows CP 1252)
          - revised:
          	03DD	GREEK SMALL LETTER DIGAMMA
          		Shape changed to more standard form
          		f-like shape retained as potential presentation form
          	0384	GREEK TONOS
          		Redesigned to add slight tilt toward right
          		Old shapes not retained
          		(note: this affects all monotonic composites)
          	period, colon, semicolon, greek question mark all enlarged
          - full release (including keyboard files) is aimed at Windows users
          - Mac OS X users can also use the fonts, but no keyboard utility is included
          
          1995 - SIL Galatia created
          - a custom-encoded font

      -----------------------------------------------------------
      SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
      -----------------------------------------------------------
      
      PREAMBLE
      The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
      development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
      efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
      open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
      with others.
      
      The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
      redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
      fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, 
      redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
      names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
      however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
      requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
      to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
